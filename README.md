# credit-eda-case-study

The objective of this case study is to identify the driver variables which can be helpful while authorising the loans, to minimise the risk of defaults. 

We'll proceed with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the available variables and get our insights to derive the driver variables from the given current and previous application data.
